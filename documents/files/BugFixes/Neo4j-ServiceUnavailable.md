## Troubleshooting: "Cannot connect to any known routers" Error

### Problem:
I encountered the error message "py2neo.errors.ServiceUnavailable: Cannot connect to any known routers" when attempting to connect to a Neo4j database.

### Solution:
The root cause of this error can often be traced to the format of the Neo4j connection URI. Ensure that you use the correct connection URI format, which should include "neo4j+ssc://" (for secure connections) rather than just "neo4j+s://". Using the correct format is crucial for establishing a stable connection to your Neo4j database. 

**Incorrect URI Format:**
```python
NEO4J_CONNECTION_URI = "neo4j+s://b3cdfccc.databases.neo4j.io"
```

**Correct URI Format:**
```python
NEO4J_CONNECTION_URI = "neo4j+ssc://b3cdfccc.databases.neo4j.io"
```

This simple adjustment to the URI can resolve the "Cannot connect to any known routers" issue and ensure your connection to the Neo4j database is successful.

By following this solution, you can avoid disruptions in your Neo4j database connectivity and continue working with confidence.
