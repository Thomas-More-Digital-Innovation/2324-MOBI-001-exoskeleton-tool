# 2324-MOBI-001-Exoskeleton-Tool

Welcome to the Exoskeleton Tool project! This website-based application is designed to serve as a valuable resource for Mobilab Thomas More Geel. It combines cutting-edge technologies to provide an informative website and a powerful tool for accessing data related to exoskeletons and sensors.

## Overview
This project focuses on creating an exoskeleton tool using a variety of technologies:
* Framework: We've chosen Flask, a Python web framework, for the backend of our application. It enables us to build robust web applications with ease.
* Frontend: The front end of our application is powered by TailwindCSS with DaisyUI components. This modern CSS framework ensures an attractive and responsive user interface.
* Backend: Our backend relies on Neo4J, a graph database, to store and retrieve data related to exoskeletons and sensors. This choice allows us to efficiently manage complex data relationships.
* CI/CD: We've implemented a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment process. This ensures that the application is always up-to-date and ready for use.
* Cloud Deployment: The application is hosted on Azure cloud infrastructure, providing scalability and reliability.

## Project Goals
Our primary goal is to create a user-friendly website that serves as an essential tool for Mobilab Thomas More Geel. Here's what we aim to achieve:

1. **Overview:** Provide an overview of who Mobilab Thomas More Geel is and what they do. This information will be readily available on the website.
2. **Data Access:** Develop a tool that communicates with the Neo4J database, enabling users to access data related to exoskeletons and sensors used by Mobilab Thomas More Geel.
3. **Long-Term Vision:** This application is not just a one-time project. We envision it being used by individuals seeking assistance in daily tasks, particularly in industrial environments. It will provide them with essential information to make informed decisions.

## My project goal - Marnik Maes (academic year 2023-2024)
The primary goal of this project revolves around enhancing the user experience, aesthetics, and performance of the existing home and tool pages. Additionally, the project aims to introduce two new key features: the "Exoskeleton List" page and the "Exoskeleton Details" page

### My objectives:
1. Improving Layout, Styling, and Performance:
 * Enhance the visual appeal and layout of the existing home and tool pages.
 * Optimize the performance of these pages to ensure a smoother user experience.
2. Exoskeleton List Page:
  * General Styling and Layout: Create an intuitive and visually appealing design for the Exoskeleton List page.
  * Exoskeleton Filter: Implement a filter system that utilizes multiple attributes to refine exoskeleton search results.
  * List of Exoskeletons: Display a comprehensive list of all exoskeletons, showcasing their "base" attributes for quick reference.
3. Exoskeleton Details Page:
  * General Styling and Layout: Design a clean and user-friendly layout for the Exoskeleton Details page.
  * Comprehensive Information: Provide detailed information about a selected exoskeleton from the Exoskeleton List. Split the information into sections such as general details, detailed specifications, movement capabilities, and   professional activities.
4. Advanced Filter Page (Future Enhancement):
  * Start-up Implementation: Consideration for an advanced filter page with more in-depth filtering options. This feature falls outside the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope and will be pursued when time permits.
