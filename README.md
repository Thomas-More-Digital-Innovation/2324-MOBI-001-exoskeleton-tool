# 2324-MOBI-001-Exoskeleton-Tool

Welcome to the Exoskeleton Tool project! This website-based application is designed to serve as a valuable resource for Mobilab Thomas More Geel. It combines cutting-edge technologies to provide an informative website and a powerful tool for accessing data related to exoskeletons and sensors.

## Overview
This project focuses on creating an exoskeleton tool using a variety of technologies:
* Framework: We've chosen Flask, a Python web framework, for the backend of our application. It enables us to build robust web applications with ease.
* Frontend: The frontend of our application is powered by TailwindCSS with DaisyUI components. This modern CSS framework ensures an attractive and responsive user interface.
* Backend: Our backend relies on Neo4J, a graph database, to store and retrieve data related to exoskeletons and sensors. This choice allows us to efficiently manage complex data relationships.
* CI/CD: We've implemented a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment process. This ensures that the application is always up-to-date and ready for use.
* Cloud Deployment: The application is hosted on Azure cloud infrastructure, providing scalability and reliability.

## Project Goals
Our primary goal is to create a user-friendly website that serves as an essential tool for Mobilab Thomas More Geel. Here's what we aim to achieve:

1. **Overview:** Provide an overview of who Mobilab Thomas More Geel is and what they do. This information will be readily available on the website.
2. **Data Access:** Develop a tool that communicates with the Neo4J database, enabling users to access data related to exoskeletons and sensors used by Mobilab Thomas More Geel.
3. **Long-Term Vision:** This application is not just a one-time project. We envision it being used by individuals seeking assistance in daily tasks, particularly in industrial environments. It will provide them with essential information to make informed decisions.
