# Tool Homepage Cards

This code defines the layout for the homepage of the "Tool" in the Sense2Extion project. It showcases a set of cards using custom classes, including "h-height-tool-homepage-cards," configured in the `tailwind.config.js` file. Each card displays information and a button that links to a exoskeleton filter page.


#### Code snippet from the `tailwind.config.js` file:
```js
    theme: {
        extend: {
            height: {
                'height-tool-homepage-cards': '35rem' 
            },
        },
    },
```
